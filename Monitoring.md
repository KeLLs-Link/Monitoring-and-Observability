### **Introduction to Monitoring for Application**
This week, you will be introduced to application monitoring, common terms used in monitoring, and why monitoring matters to developers. You'll also learn about the types of monitoring that give you visibility into app performance and connected...

### Monitoring Systems and Techniques

This week, you will learn about synthetic monitoring and its importance. You’ll also explore the synthetic monitoring tools, their uses, as well as features. You will gain insights into how application monitoring allows developers to observe applications and how monitoring can provide valuable insights into application performance. You’ll learn about Prometheus and the benefits of using an analytics tool. You’ll also learn about Grafana, which is typically used with Prometheus. You’ll explore how a visualization tool, like Grafana, can organize all of your monitoring data. Additionally, you’ll discover how the right visualization tool can help your organization and that visualization includes many options, like charts, graphs, and timelines. Finally, you’ll learn about alerting, the responsive part of a monitoring system, and you’ll learn about the metric, log, activity log, and smart detection alerts.

- **Introduction to Synthetic Monitoring**

***Synthetic monitoring, also called synthetic testing or proactive monitoring***, is a method used to keep track of how well an application or website is performing. It involves creating a set of predefined actions or requests that a user would typically make on the website or application.
