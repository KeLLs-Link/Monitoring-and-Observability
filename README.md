# Monitoring-and-Observability
Monitoring and Observability for Development and DevOps

This week, you will be introduced to application monitoring, common terms used in monitoring, and why monitoring matters to developers. You'll also learn about the types of monitoring that give you visibility into app performance and connected information technology (IT) systems. You'll become familiar with the four Golden Signals of Monitoring and learn to use the Golden Signals to improve your monitoring systems. Then, you will explore the differences between the Monitoring and Evaluation processes. You'll learn that monitoring is a routine, ongoing process, while evaluation is a long-term process. You'll learn more about the components of monitoring, including metrics, observability, and alerts. You'll also explore the importance of tracking host-based, application, network and connectivity, and server pool metrics. Finally, you'll learn about the need for application monitoring and its importance.

**Difference between Monitoring and Evaluation**
- ***Monitoring*** 

is a routine, ongoing process, and it is an operational-level activity. Itâ€™s usually performed by developers and their teams. 
In contrast, 

- ***Evaluations***

are long-term processes that may happen only a few times. 
Evaluation is a business-level activity, and It is usually performed by others not involved in developing the application.
